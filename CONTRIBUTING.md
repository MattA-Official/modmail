## Questions

> We assume you have already read all avalible [documentation](https://github.com/matta-official/modmail/wiki).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [issues](https://github.com/matta-official/modmail/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question please do the following:

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/matta-official/modmail/issues/new).
2. Provide as much context as you can about what you’re running into.
3. Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then respond with an answer as soon as possible.

## Bug Reports

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. installing the wrong discord.js version.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/matta-official/modmail/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS and Platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of node.js
  - Config (if you are using a config file)
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent directly to @MattA-Official.

## Suggestions

Before you suggest an enhancement or a new feature, it is best to search for existing [issues](https://github.com/matta-official/modmail/issues?q=label%3Asuggestion) and [pull requests](https://github.com/matta-official/modmail/pulls) that might be related to your idea.

We also ask that you check your idea hasn't already been impelemted and is behind a configurable option.

- Use a **clear and descriptive title**
- Describe the **use case** for the feature
- Provide a detailed description of the idea or enhancement
- You may want to include images or other media to help explain your idea
- Finally, explain why this feature would be useful to others
